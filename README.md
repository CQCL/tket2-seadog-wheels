### Seadog wheels

This repo is currently empty. Its sole purpose is to distribute compiled wheels
of custom versions of [tket2](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2) that include the
_seadog_ optimiser.

Wheels are currently only built for MacOS ARM. Other platforms will follow. All
compiled wheels can be found under [releases](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2-seadog-wheels/releases).
