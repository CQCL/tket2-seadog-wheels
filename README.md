# Seadog optimiser

Seadog is an optimiser for tket2, that uses concepts from graph rewriting (aka graph transformation systems) to transform a graph representing a computation. The objective of the optimiser is to find a modified graph that represents a computation that is equivalent to the original input, but such that the estimated computation cost is minimal.

Seadog is the second optimiser after Badger. They both share the same API and
the same objectives, but they differ in how the optimisation is performed.

Note: Badger used to work differently (and as of 31/10/25, tket2/main and all released versions still expose the _old_ badger: hereafter _old-badger_ and _new-badger_). old-badger only works by providing equivalence classes of circuits. By contrast, new-badger can support a much larger variety of rewrites using the new API that consists of Matchers and Replacers, which is shared with Seadog. Under the hood, Badger has not changed, but the expressivity of its API has significantly improved in the new version.

### High level overview of how the optimisers (both badger and seadog) work

1. A quantum computation (represented as a HUGR graph) is passed to the optimiser as input
1. Possible graph rewrites are generated by tket2. Rewrites always have a left hand side (LHS): a subgraph that has been matched); and a right hand side (RHS): a new graph that should be inserted in place of the matched LHS
   - rewrites can be generated by the combination of a tket2 `Matcher` and a tket2 `Replacer` (combined using a `MatchReplaceRewriter` object), or
   - rewrites can be generated using pattern matching and

### Future research directions for Seadog

This repo is currently empty. Its sole purpose is to distribute compiled wheels
of custom versions of [tket2](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2) that include the
_seadog_ optimiser.

Wheels are currently only built for MacOS ARM. Other platforms will follow. All
compiled wheels can be found under [releases](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2-seadog-wheels/releases).
